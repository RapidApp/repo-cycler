# repo-cycler

This is a single-purpose utility designed to change checked-out tags
in a target git repo. It provides a simple terminal UI to navigate
and cycle through tags, forward and backwards.

I wrote this is aid in live demos to be able to easily change between
pre-defined code states of an example application. This was originally
written for the YAPC::NA 2016 talk on RapidApp.

code is not yet complete/working and is still in progress...
